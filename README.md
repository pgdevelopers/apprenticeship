## :bulb: Why We Do Apprenticeships
Lots of companies are focused on hiring experienced developers; in contrast, we see apprenticeships as good investments that can help us bolster our internal engineering presence at P&G. Early-career developers like you are untapped resources that can thrive in the type of environment we foster on our team. We love paired programming and do it daily. We detest gatekeeping and believe it's important to share knowledge across the team and P&G at large. Lastly, we strive for diversity in our team's makeup, and we see the apprenticeship as a means to create opportunities for people from a multitude of backgrounds and skillsets. 

## :eyeglasses: Who We're Looking For
We're looking for early-career developers based in Cincinnati (or driving distance from Cincy) seeking hands-on experience working in cloud technology. Candidates should be comfortable working independently and in groups to solve challenging engineering problems. Good communication skills will be essential to keep your team and mentor informed about how you are progressing with the curriculum and what support you need along the way. We don't expect candidates to have deep expertise or prior exposure to any technologies we use. We do expect candidates to be kind, curious, and gritty, as these are the characteristics of our team that drive us to deliver world-class technological solutions.

## :white_check_mark: Hiring process
Our initial speed interviews will take place in the last two weeks of July 2022. Candidates moving forward will be invited to a technical interview where they will complete code challenges representative of technologies used by the Lightyear team. Don't worry; members of the team will be at your disposal if you have any questions or hit any road bumps. Our team does a lot of pairing, and we're happy to help each other out of jams.
If you worked on a side project you want us to consider in our deliberation, make sure it's published to GitHub and referenced on your resume. If you want to demo it for us, let us know you'd like to arrange a separate meeting outside the required interviews.
